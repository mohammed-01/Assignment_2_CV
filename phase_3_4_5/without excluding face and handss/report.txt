# Instance Segmentation and Gender Classification

## Phase 3: Data Preparation for Instance Segmentation and Gender Classification

### 1. Data Annotation
- Annotated 200 images (150 for training, 50 for testing) with gender information (male/female).
- Utilized an annotation tool to label the dataset with gender.

### 2. Script to Include Annotations (Without Face and Hands Exclusion)
- Implemented a script that processes the annotations and prepares the dataset for training.

### 3. Registering the Dataset
- Registered the LV-MHP-V2 dataset for training and testing in Detectron2.

## Phase 4: Instance Segmentation and Gender Classification Model Training

### 1. Model Configuration
- Configured the model to use Detectron2's Mask R-CNN architecture.
- Set hyperparameters including learning rate, batch size, and evaluation period.

### 2. Training the Model
- Trained the instance segmentation model with gender classification.
